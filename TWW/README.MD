# TWW (VSA DSS 2020.1 Import Ready)

Small things about datamodel initialization and customization rules in TWW.
SQL will help us to retrieve 3D geometries and customizations from QGEP.

## Prerequisites :

You will need to upgrade pum and pirogue to the latest versions to be able to interact with TWW via pum and oQtopus. You have also to be on postgreSQL 13+ to perform the initialization of TWW via oQtopus.
